### Weekly Recap

#### Promises
- Promises comes to managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They provide a clear structure with states like pending, fulfilled, and rejected, which makes handling async code much more predictable and manageable.
#### Async / Await
- Async functions are a great way to simplify the writing of asynchronous code. They return promises automatically, which means we donâ€™t have to worry about chaining .then() calls.
- The await keyword is incredibly useful, in my view. It allows asynchronous code to be written in a way that feels more like synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand. 
#### HTPP Web Server
- The http module in Node.js is essential for anyone looking to build web servers or APIs. Creating a basic server with Node.js using the http module is straightforward: you import the module, define a request handler, and set up the server to listen on a specific port.
